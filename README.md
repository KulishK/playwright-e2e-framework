## 🛠 Features & Architecture

This repository showcases advanced QA Engineering practices:

1. **Page Object Model (POM) + Dependency Injection:** Page elements and actions are encapsulated within the `pages/` directory. Rather than manually instantiating these pages in every block, Playwright Custom Fixtures (`fixtures/baseTest.ts`) inject these objects seamlessly into `test()` definitions.
2. **Selector Strategy:** Standardized around Playwright's specific semantic locator functions (e.g., `.getByTestId()`, `hasText`) coupled with explicit `data-testid` attributes. This insulates tests from fragile CSS changes and heavily aids frontend refactors.
3. **Flakiness Handling & Stability:**
   - Strict avoidance of arbitrary `.waitForTimeout()` calls.
   - Built-in Playwright auto-waiting algorithm for element actionability.
   - Intelligent automatic retries (Configured for 2 retries inside `playwright.config.ts` running strictly *only* on CI to reduce local noise). 
   - State isolation: Each test gets a completely clean, isolated Browser Context.
4. **Data Isolation:** `utils/testData.ts` enforces that hardcoded text values (usernames, validation strings) don't litter test files, enabling rapid maintenance when copy/content changes occur.
5. **Cross-Environment Execution:** Use `.env` coupled with `cross-env` inside the `package.json` to effortlessly switch targets (Dev / Staging) using `npm run test:dev`.

## ⚙️ How to Setup & Run

### 1. Installation
Clone the repo and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
npx playwright install --with-deps
```

### 2. Available Scripts
- `npm run test`: Run tests headlessly (Staging default)
- `npm run test:ui`: Run tests in Playwright's interactive UI mode
- `npm run test:dev`: Run pointing to Dev environment
- `npm run report`: Open standard HTML report
- `npm run lint`: Lint TypeScript files

### 3. Allure Reporting
Playwright produces Allure-compatible outputs.
```bash
# Output results to an allure server
npm run allure:generate
npm run allure:open
```

## ☁️ CI/CD Execution Strategy

The `.github/workflows/playwright.yml` handles CI logic. Key benefits of this pipeline:
- **Parallelism:** Tests are aggressively chunked automatically across available workers.
- **Trace Viewer Retention:** Traces / Videos are retained specifically on *failure* in `playwright.config.ts`. In CI, they are bundled in the uploaded Github Artifacts for immediate debugging of fragile pipelines.
- **Workflow Dispatch:** QA can manually run standard regressions with parameterized environments from the GitHub UI avoiding developer intervention.
